# Mini Docs

## Why

1. The absence of good documentation slows down and even blocks professionals from doing their jobs.
2. The _turnover_ on teams can lead to losing critical information. 
3. Writing docs is hard and we need some guidance to keep our knowledge safe and useful.

## Who needs to document?

**Everyone on your team!** Everyone can benefit from reading a good documentation (even the author can forget things) so everyone should give it back by documenting critical information.

## What should we document?

**Everything that's not coded!** Big decisions, planning, tools, system names, portals, IPs, environments, organizational charts, client contacts, manual processes...

## Where to save them?

**In the cloud!** You can use some a document-specific solution or leverage a shared-files or code repository. Collaboration is a key part of good documentation!

## When to write a doc?

**While you do your work!** Use a notepad and keep notes during the process. It keeps critical info at hand and helps you select what you should document.

## How to write them?

1. [Create a single starting point](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/single-starting-point/)

2. [Do not duplicate information](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/do-not-copy/)

3. [Use simple files](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/simple-files/)

4. [Use hirerarchy](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/hierarchy/)

5. [Break big documents into small ones](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/break-big-documents/)
