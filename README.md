# Mini Docs

## Why

1. The absence of a good documentation slows down and even blocks professionals from doing their jobs.
2. The _turnover_ ยน on teams can lead to loose critical informations. 
3. Writing docs is hard and we need some guide to keep our knowledge safe and usefull.

## Who needs to document?

**Everyone on your team!** Everyone can benefit from reading a good doc (even the author can forget something) so everyone should give it back by document critical info.

## What we should document?

**Everything that's not coded!** Big decisions, planing, tools, system names, portals, IPs, enviroments, team organograms, client contacts, manual processes...

## Where to save them?

**On cloud!** You can use some document specific solution or leverage a file solution or code repository. The colaboration is key part of good docs!

## When to write a doc?

**While you do some work!** Get some notepad and keep notes during the process. It keeps the critical info at hand and helps you to select what you should document.

## How to write them?

1. You should have a single starting point - [/single-starting-point](/single-starting-point/)

2. You should not add or copy information that can be found in other tools.

3. You should have a clear hirearchical structure of documents.

4. You should use simple files.

5. You should use simple text formating to publish information.

6. You should use text hirearchy with: Title, sections, subsections and lists.

7. You should add references to related contents.

8. Do not let a document increase in size, make it in small pieces.

9. You should have a sumary listing all your sources of knowledge.

10. Make your documents accessible to your users.
