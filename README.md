# Mini Docs

## Why

1. The absence of a good documentation slows down and even blocks professionals from doing their jobs.
2. The _turnover_ on teams can lead to loose critical informations. 
3. Writing docs is hard and we need some guide to keep our knowledge safe and usefull.

## Who needs to document?

**Everyone on your team!** Everyone can benefit from reading a good doc (even the author can forget something) so everyone should give it back by document critical info.

## What we should document?

**Everything that's not coded!** Big decisions, planing, tools, system names, portals, IPs, enviroments, team organograms, client contacts, manual processes...

## Where to save them?

**On cloud!** You can use some document specific solution or leverage a file solution or code repository. The colaboration is key part of good docs!

## When to write a doc?

**While you do your work!** Get some notepad and keep notes during the process. It keeps the critical info at hand and helps you to select what you should document.

## How to write them?

1. Create a single starting point - [/single-starting-point](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/single-starting-point/)

2. Do not duplicate information. - [/do-not-copy](https://edumco.github.io/mini-docs/do-not-copy/)

3. Create a document hierarchy.

4. Use simple files.

5. Use simple formating.

6. Use text hirearchy (titles, sections...)

7. Break big documents in small ones.

8. Make your documents accessible.
