Multiple sources of information creates confusion during search for useful information. To mitigate this problem we should create a page or document that guides the reader throughout the multiple sources of knowledge.

## Create a Web Page

No matter if you use a shared folder, a git repo or a complete document solution you can create a simple web page to list your knkowledge resources, so let's see some examples.

### Shared folder 📂

You can place a file called `index.html` with a list of all the documents or repositories and add it to the favorits bar on your browser.

### Markdown readme 📃

Repository managers (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Azure Repos, Sourceforge ...) allows you to create beautiful webpages using 'readme.md' files.

### Document portal 🌐

Most documentation tools allows you to creating a main page where you can centralize all links. 

## Organizing the sources

Now you have an entry point you have to guide your reader throughout all the information sources.

A simple summary with a brief description per iten can give the necessary guidence. 

> **Dont forget to link the itens to the respective documentation.**

Ex:

- Bitbucket - List of all repos 
	- Product A - All the repos for the product A components
	- Product B - All the repos for the product B components
	- Shared Components - All repos shared between products
- Confluence
	- Onboard for new team members 
	- Tool configuration
	- List of all projects
	- Support
- Sharepoint
	- Human Resources
	- Marketing
	- Design
