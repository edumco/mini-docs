Multiple sources of information create confusion when searching for useful information. To mitigate this problem, we should create a page or document that guides the reader through  multiple sources.

## Create a Web Page

Whether you use a shared folder, a git repository, or a complete document solution, you can create a simple web page to list your knowledge resources. Let's see some examples.

### Shared folder 📂

You can create a file called `index.html` containing a list of all the documents or repositories, and add it to your browser’s favorites bar.

### Markdown readme 📃

Repository managers (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, Azure Repos, SourceForge, etc.) allow you to create web pages using `README.md` files.

### Document portal 🌐

Most documentation tools allow you to create a main page where you can centralize all your links.

## Organizing the sources

Now that you have an entry point, you need to guide your reader through all the information sources.

A simple summary with a brief description for each item can provide the necessary guidance.

> **Don't forget to link the items to their respective documentation.**

For example:

- Bitbucket - List of all repos 
	- Product A - All the repos for the product A components
	- Product B - All the repos for the product B components
	- Shared Components - All repos shared between products
- Confluence
	- Onboard for new team members 
	- Tool configuration
	- List of all projects
	- Support
- Sharepoint
	- Human Resources
	- Marketing
	- Design
	- Development
