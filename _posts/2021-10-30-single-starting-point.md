# Single starting point 🏠

Sometimes is hard to have a single source of information and this can create lots of confusion during searching for useful information. 

To mitigate this problem we should create a page or document that guides the reader throughout the multiple sources of knowledge.

## Pages

No matter if you use a shared folder, a git repo or a complete document solution you can create a simple web page to list your knkowledge resources, so let's see some examples.

### Shared folder 📂

You can place a file called `index.html` and create a link for this file so you can add it to your browser favorits bar.

### Markdown readme 📃

The most used cloud based repository managers (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Azure Repos, Sourceforge ...) allows you to create a file called `readme.md` an use simple text to create beautiful webpages.

### Document portal 🌐

Most documentation tools allows you to creating a main page where you. 

## Product Documentation

One of the easyest ways to guarantee a central point is to organize documentation around products. 

This technic helps to centralize docs for the the team members and to restrict clients access to operational data only.

```shell
Company documentation/
    Development/
        Products
          Product 1/
          Product 2/
...
```
