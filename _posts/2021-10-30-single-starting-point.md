Sometimes is hard to have a single source of information and this can create lots of confusion during searching for useful information. 

To mitigate this problem we should create a page or document that guides the reader throughout the multiple sources of knowledge.

## Creating a Web Page

No matter if you use a shared folder, a git repo or a complete document solution you can create a simple web page to list your knkowledge resources, so let's see some examples.

### Shared folder 📂

You can place a file called `index.html` and create a link for this file so you can add it to your browser favorits bar.

### Markdown readme 📃

The most used cloud based repository managers (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Azure Repos, Sourceforge ...) allows you to create a file called `readme.md` an use simple text to create beautiful webpages.

### Document portal 🌐

Most documentation tools allows you to creating a main page where you can centralize all main links. 


## Organizing the sources

Now you have an entry point you have to guide your reader throughout all the information sources.


A simple summary with a brief description per iten can give the necessary guidence. 

> **Dont forget to link the itens to the respective documentation.**

Ex:

- Bitbucket - List of all repos 
	- Product A - All the repos for the product A components
	- Product B - All the repos for the product B components
	- Shared Components - All repos shared between products
- Confluence
	- Onboard for new team members 
	- Tool configuration
	- List of all projects
