Every company has its organization rules that reflects the  established hierarchy. You should mirror this hierarchy to create a usefull documentation.

## Internal vs External 

First you have to divide the documentation between internal and external but the internal documentation is directed to the workers and the external to the clients 

External documentation are an important part to the company marketing, sales and support. It should be treated with a high degree of precision and politeness otherwise it can hurt company's image.

you should always use multiple teams to control and review the writing and publishing of this kind of documentation 

the internal documentation although very important can be less strict in terms of precision or type of language you should always follow a formal and polite manner but you can have pictures emojis and other forms of communication that help the understanding of users 

by divide the sectors inside Company you can communicate better and create a sense of connection between writers
