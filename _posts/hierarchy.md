Every company has its organization rules that reflects the  established hierarchy. You should mirror this hierarchy to create a usefull documentation.

## Internal vs External 

First you have to divide the documentation between internal and external but the internal documentation is directed to the workers and the external to the clients 

External documentation are an important part to the company marketing, sales and support. It should be treated with a high degree of precision and politeness otherwise it can hurt company's image.

### External documentation

Companies should always delegate their communication to a especialized team using multiple steps to write, review and approve before publishing.

To reduce possible bottlenecks teams can be allowed to publish some types of communication like technical blocks or user manual but should follow strict rules to create a consistent communication.

### Internal documentation

Can be less strict in terms of precision or completeness. You can use pictures, videos, emojis and other informal elements but you should always be polite and respectful to keep things professional. 

Ex: Imagine a configuration manual
