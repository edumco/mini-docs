# Recording screens and creating small video files

## Record less frames per second

Normal speed is 60 frames per second but you can perceive motion using less frames: 24 on movies, 12 on animations.

So using 12 frames youre recording a fifth (20%) and if you're recording a slide you can go even further using 5fps and keeping only 5% of video data.

## Reduce the output resolution

Sometimes the text is not important or is big enought that you can reduce the output resolution to gain more space

- 1080p = 100%
- 720p  =  44%
- 540p  =  25%  (after this point things become hard to read)

## Use the best realtime compressor _possible_ to record

The recording process can make your computer cry, give preference to hardware accelerated video codecs for the recording moment. Intel has Quicksync inside its processors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quick_Sync_Video)

## Use a good quality to record

You can always compress more later, but only compress again if you have time to run a better compressor.

Ex.: 
- Original take: 1080p 8fps x264 Quicksync Balanced - 145mb
- Compression 1: 720p  5fps x265 Qualit level 27 - 43Mb
- Compression 2: 540p  5fps x265 Qualit level 27 - 35Mb
